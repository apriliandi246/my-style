			What is HTML ????
		</button>

		<p class="collapse__message">
			HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is the code that is used to structure a web page and its
			content. For example,
			content
			could be structured within a set of paragraphs, a list of bulleted points, or using images and
			data tables. As the
			title
			suggests, this article will give you a basic understanding of HTML and its functions.</p>

			What is CSS ????
		</button>

		<p class="collapse__message">
			CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) allows you to create great-looking web pages, but how does it
			work
			under the hood?
			This
			article explains what CSS is, with a simple syntax example, and also covers some key terms
			about
			the language.

			What is Javascript ????
		</button>

		<p class="collapse__message">
			JavaScript is a scripting or programming language that allows you to implement complex
			features
			on web pages —
			every
			time a web page does more than just sit there and display static information for you to look
			at
			— displaying
			timely
			content updates, interactive maps, animated 2D/3D graphics, scrolling video jukeboxes, etc. —
			you can bet that
			JavaScript is probably involved. It is the third layer of the layer cake of standard web
			technologies, two of
			which
			(HTML and CSS) we have covered in much more detail in other parts of the Learning Area.

			What is Svelte ????
		</button>

		<p class="collapse__message">
			Svelte is a radical new approach to building user interfaces. Whereas traditional frameworks
			like React and Vue do
			the
			bulk of their work in the browser, Svelte shifts that work into a compile step that happens
			when
			you build your
			app..
			Instead of using techniques like virtual DOM diffing, Svelte writes code that surgically
			updates
			the DOM when the
			state
			of your app changes.
