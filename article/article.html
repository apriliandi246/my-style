	<p>Maybe you think with this blog title, "WHAT'S WRONG WITH THIS PHENOMENON". Yes, that's not wrong but many people
		do
		this
		phenomenon all the time. For example, if a new Javascript framework or library comes out and programmers in some
		groups
		or some forum say "SHOULD I LEARN THIS".</p>

	<br>

	<p>
		If you just use that new framework or library just because it's very trending and a lot of people talk about it, I
		think
		why not change your perspective about this phenomenon. For example, why not try to visit the documentation and
		read
		about that framework or library. If you have time, find out why the author of the framework or library makes this
		thing,
		what problem the author solves, or even the philosophy behind this framework or library.
	</p>

	<br>

	<p>
		For example, when I wanna learn another Javascript frontend framework, and that framework gives me a lot of
		productivity
		and the performance is also very good. Finally, I decided to choose Svelte, and Svelte solve my problem about
		productivity and performance.
	</p>

	<br>

	<p>
		On the productivity side, Svelte gives me a lot of productivity while I am coding. For example, Svelte has a lot
		of
		features, for example, built-in transition, animation, state management, and more. Even Svelte give me some useful
		utilities that help me a lot, for example, scoped style, unused CSS code, and more.
	</p>

	<br>

	<p>
		On the performant side, Svelte is not inferior to other Javascript frontend frameworks or even Svelte has better
		performance in some situations. And I'm also doing research on why Rich Harris (Svelte's author) makes Svelte,
		what
		problem he solves, and more.
